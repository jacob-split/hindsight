# Cookbook

Practical patterns, recipes, and complete applications for building with Hindsight.

## Recipes

Step-by-step tutorials and use cases as interactive Jupyter notebooks.

### [Hindsight Quickstart](/cookbook/recipes/quickstart)

This notebook covers the basics of using Hindsight: - **Retain**: Store information in memory - **Recall**: Retrieve memories matching a query - **Reflect**: Generate insights from memories Make sure
